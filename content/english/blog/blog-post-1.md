## Supervised Learning

Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized into four major categories: 1. Supervised, 2. Unsupervised, 3. Semi-Supervised and 4. Reinforcement Learning. In the writing we will be discussing Supervised learning algorithms. Main questions, which we will address here, are:

  1.   What is the supervised learning.
  
  2.   Types of supervised algorithms.
  
  3.   When do we use these algorithms.
  

### What is the supervised learning: 

The algorithm consist of input variables and output variable pairs. In which the expert tries to map the relationship between inputs and outcome variable. This mapping is a nothing but the algorithm which we use in general, for example predicting weight of a person given his attributes such as height, sex and complexion etc.


### Types of supervised learning

These are of two types: one is regression models and another one is classification models. Main distinctive difference between the two's are there nature of prediction. Regression techniques provides outcome in continuous fashion and on the other hand classification predicts probability or the class of the outcome which is discrete in nature. For example price estimation of a particular company share is a regression and classifying poor and rich customers is a example of classification.

The basic algorithms are (renown ones):

**1. Regression**

  - Linear Regression
  - Tree / Random Forest for regression
  - Gradient Boosting for regression
  - Non Linear Regression
  - Time Series Regression Techniques
  - Neural Network for Regression


**2. Classification** 

  - Logistic Regression / Logit Model 
  - Tree / Random Forest for classification
  - Gradient Boosting for classification
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Neural Network for classification
  
  
  
### When do we use these algorithms 

We consciously or unconsciously been familiar with these algorithms for example when we login to email on Google, sometimes Google ask us for spam or non spam labeling for a email sent to us. And we then feed our answer afterwards whenever the app finds a similar pattern in a mail it automatically classifies it as a spam and send it to the folder.

Recently most of the mobile technology firms used our mobile phones to predict if we do are suffering from COVID-19 virus or not. Most of them used the temperature of our body, which cell phones gets each time when it touches our body, to predict If we have virus fever or not. If the temperature is persistently higher then the software predicts it as COVID-19 suspect.
